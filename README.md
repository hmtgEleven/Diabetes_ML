Prediction of Diabetes Empowered with Fused Machine Learning
Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes using a fusion of multiple machine-learning techniques. Diabetes is a widespread chronic condition with significant health implications. Early detection and intervention are critical for effective management and prevention of complications associated with diabetes. By combining various machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance the predictive accuracy and robustness of the model, thereby providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes.
Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project comprises diverse health-related features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other physiological attributes. It is obtained from reputable medical sources and anonymized to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical standards.
Methodology

    Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare it for model training.
    Feature Selection and Fusion: Different machine learning algorithms are employed to extract relevant features from the dataset. These features are then fused using techniques such as ensemble learning, stacking, or feature combination to create a comprehensive feature set.
    Model Training: The fused feature set is used to train a variety of machine learning models, including but not limited to logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and gradient boosting classifiers.
    Ensemble Learning: Ensemble techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking are applied to combine the predictions of multiple base models, thereby improving the overall predictive performance.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning of model hyperparameters is performed using techniques such as grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.
    Evaluation: The performance of the fused machine learning model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
